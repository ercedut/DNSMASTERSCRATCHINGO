# DNSMaster: Lightweight, Fast, and Customizable DNS Server

DNSMaster is a lightweight, high-performance DNS server built from scratch using Go (Golang). This project is designed to handle basic DNS queries and provides a customizable architecture, enabling developers to create their own DNS solutions.

## Features

- **Lightweight and Fast**: Leverages Go's performance and concurrency model for high-speed DNS resolution.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to support custom DNS records, advanced routing, or specific use cases.
- **Simple to Use**: Minimal setup required to get started. Perfect for learning DNS protocols or building custom DNS tools.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source and free to use, modify, and distribute.

## Why DNSMaster?

- **Learn DNS Internals**: Understand how DNS works by exploring a fully functional, minimal implementation.
- **Build Your Own DNS**: Use this project as a foundation to create a custom DNS server tailored to your needs.
- **Lightweight Alternative**: Ideal for environments where resource usage is critical, such as IoT devices or edge computing.

## Getting Started
